# AOC2023  
 Problems from Advent of Code 2023, solved with Typescript/Node  
  
To run the solution code, compile the Typescript code with `./compile.sh`  
Then, run the web server locally with `run.sh`. Run with the `--dev` or `-d` flag to use Nodemon for development.  
Enter the input for the problem to the `input` file as plain text.  
Optionally, you can enter a second input to `testinput`, such as the test input provided by AoC.  
Navigate to the address provided (`http://127.0.0.1:3000` by default) and enter the day and level as query parameters, eg `http://127.0.0.1:3000?day=1&level=1`.  

TODO: Add an index page w/ React to allow easy navigation between days/levels.
